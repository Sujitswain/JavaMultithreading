CPU:
        The CPU, (Brain) is responsible for executing instructions from programs. 
    It performs basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations
    specified by the instructions. 

PROGRAM:
        A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells
    the computer how ot perform a specific task. Microsoft word is a program that allows 
    users to create and edit documents.

CORE:
        A core is an individual processing unit within a CPU. Modern CPUs can have
    multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

    eg. 
        QUAD-CORE:
                A quad-core processor has four cores, allowing it to perform four tasks
        simultaneously. For instance, one core could handle your web browser, another 
        your music player, another a download manager, and another a background system 
        update.

PROCESS:
        A process is an instance of a program that is being executed. When a program runs,
    the operating system creates a process to manage its execution. When we open Microsoft 
    Word, it becomes a process  in the operating system.
