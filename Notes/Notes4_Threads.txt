    THREADS:

            A thread is a lightweight process, the smallest unit of
        processing. Java supports multithreading through its 
        ** java.lang.Thread class ** and
        ** java.lang.Runnable interface **

    MAIN THREAD:

            When a java program starts, one thread begins running 
        immediately, which is called the main thread. This thread is 
        responsible for executing the main method of a program.
